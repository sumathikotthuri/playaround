Git configurations can be set in three levels
--local
--global
--system

--local is the most narrow level, -- system is the most broader level configuration
Narrower level configurations always takes the precedence.

when configuration are done with no level then by default --local is applied by git, in this case configurations are stored prject specific in .git/config file
When configurations are done using -- global, configurations are stored for all projects to one user in ~/.gitconfig
When configurations are done using --system, configurations are stored for all projects for all users in /etc/gitconfig file

git config --global user.name "Suma"
To configure email to your git hub account
git config --global user.email "suma@gmail.com"
To manage line endings in all types in all types of operating system file
git config --global core.autocrlf true
git config --global core.autocrlf input  (Difference between input and true ???)
